## Background
The GoLogin browser, used for managing multiple browser profiles, requires a compatible ChromeDriver version for automation tasks. Since the GoLogin browser version is in the 135.x.x range, we identified and downloaded ChromeDriver version 135.0.7049.114 for macOS ARM64. This document details that process and provides instructions for sourcing other ChromeDriver versions as needed.

## Steps to Identify and Download ChromeDriver 135.0.7049.114

### Step 1: Check Chrome for Testing Historical Release
To find the specific ChromeDriver version for Chrome 135, we referred to the Chrome for Testing historical release page:

- **URL**: [Chrome for Testing - LATEST_RELEASE_135](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/LATEST_RELEASE_135)

This page provides access to historical release data for Chrome version 135.

### Step 2: Verify ChromeDriver Version
From the historical release page, we accessed the associated documentation file, which specified the exact ChromeDriver version:

- **Version**: 135.0.7049.114

This version was confirmed to be compatible with the GoLogin browser's 135.x.x version range.

### Step 3: Access the Chrome for Testing Page
To locate the download link for ChromeDriver, we visited the main Chrome for Testing page:

- **URL**: [Chrome for Testing](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/)

This page lists available ChromeDriver versions and their download links for various platforms.

### Step 4: Download ChromeDriver for macOS ARM64
Based on the verified version (135.0.7049.114) and the target platform (macOS ARM64), we used the following direct download link for the ChromeDriver binary:

- **Download URL**: [chromedriver-mac-arm64.zip](https://storage.googleapis.com/chrome-for-testing-public/135.0.7049.114/mac-arm64/chromedriver-mac-arm64.zip)

The ChromeDriver binary was successfully downloaded using this link.

## Finding ChromeDriver for Other Versions
If you need a ChromeDriver version other than 135.0.7049.114 (e.g., for a different GoLogin or Chrome browser version), follow these steps:

1. **Determine Your Browser Version**:
   - Check the version of your browser (e.g., GoLogin or Chrome). The major version (e.g., 136, 137) must match the ChromeDriver major version.
   - For GoLogin, find the version in the browser settings or documentation.

2. **Visit the Chrome for Testing Historical Release Page**:
   - Navigate to the Chrome for Testing historical release page for your desired major version.
   - Replace `135` in the URL with your target version (e.g., for version 136, use [LATEST_RELEASE_136](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/LATEST_RELEASE_136)).
   - If the exact version page doesn't exist, check the main [Chrome for Testing](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/) page for available versions.

3. **Verify the ChromeDriver Version**:
   - Access the documentation file linked on the historical release page (e.g., `LATEST_RELEASE_136`).
   - Note the exact ChromeDriver version (e.g., 136.0.xxxx.xxx).

4. **Locate the Download Link**:
   - From the [Chrome for Testing](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/) page, find the download section for your ChromeDriver version.
   - Alternatively, construct the download URL using the pattern:
     ```
     https://storage.googleapis.com/chrome-for-testing-public/<version>/<platform>/chromedriver-<platform>.zip
     ```
     - Replace `<version>` with the exact version (e.g., 136.0.xxxx.xxx).
     - Replace `<platform>` with your platform (e.g., `mac-arm64`, `mac-x64`, `linux64`, `win32`, `win64`).
     - Example for version 136.0.1234.56 on macOS ARM64:
       ```
       https://storage.googleapis.com/chrome-for-testing-public/136.0.1234.56/mac-arm64/chromedriver-mac-arm64.zip
       ```

5. **Download and Verify**:
   - Download the ChromeDriver zip file from the constructed or provided URL.
   - Extract the binary and verify compatibility by testing it with your browser.

**Note**: Always ensure the ChromeDriver major version matches your browser's major version to avoid compatibility issues.

## Compatibility with GoLogin Browser
The GoLogin browser, running on version 135.x.x, requires a ChromeDriver version with the same major version (135). The downloaded ChromeDriver version 135.0.7049.114 aligns with this requirement, ensuring compatibility for automation tasks on macOS ARM64. For other GoLogin versions, use the steps in the [Finding ChromeDriver for Other Versions](#finding-chromedriver-for-other-versions) section to source the appropriate ChromeDriver.

## Conclusion
This document detailed the process of downloading ChromeDriver version 135.0.7049.114 for macOS ARM64, compatible with GoLogin browser version 135.x.x. Additionally, it provided a general guide for finding ChromeDriver for other versions, ensuring flexibility for different browser versions and platforms. Always verify the ChromeDriver version against your browser's major version and platform to ensure seamless automation.
